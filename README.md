An app created for Pragyan Hackathon 21' which is used to monitor garbage disposals in different areas with the info provided by the public.

### Challenges Faced

We were successfully able to build <a href="https://github.com/tharun571/Geo-Tracking-Garbage-ML-Algo"> Machine Learning Model </a> to predict whether the picture taken is garbage or clean,
but the implementation of the model into the app was not successfull.
It eventually took us time to discover the components but too much time to implement it here.
